  "SSH Binary Packet Protocol primitives (RFC 4253 §6), KEXINIT algorithm
  negotiation (§7.1), a single curve25519-sha256 key-exchange method
  (RFC 8731) and its key derivation (§4253 §7.2). This is the HARD,
  security-sensitive part of this repo's Phase-1 transport — see
  `kotobase.sftp.transport.ssh`'s docstring for the overall EXPERIMENTAL /
  pending-security-review framing this entire transport/ subtree is
  under. `.cljs`-only (node:crypto + Buffer): cannot run on the JVM, and
  is never `:require`d by anything under `kotobase.sftp.fs` (the pure
  Phase-1 core) — see that namespace's own docstring for why the
  decoupling matters.

  HONESTY NOTE ON RFC/INTEROP SCOPE: these primitives are written to be
  RFC-4253/8731-SHAPED and self-consistent (this repo's own client and
  server, both implemented here, genuinely key-exchange and decrypt each
  other's traffic — see test/kotobase/sftp/transport/ssh_demo.cljs for
  the real cross-process proof). They have NOT been tested for byte-exact
  interop against a real OpenSSH client or server, and this repo makes NO
  claim that they would pass such a test today. IETF's own secsh WG draft
  this whole repo is named after was never ratified to an RFC in the
  first place (see README) — RFC 4253/8731 (the transport layer this
  namespace borrows its shape from) are separate, ratified specs that ARE
  real RFCs, referenced here only for the wire-format shape, not as a
  compliance claim for this implementation."
