;; Not a unit test — an EXECUTABLE end-to-end demo that must genuinely
;; pass when run, matching the verification style
;; ADR-2607161817/kotoba-lang/dtn's tcp_demo.cljs established: it spawns
;; an actual second `nbb` OS process (bin/sftp_node.cljs, found via
;; $PATH), connects to its real bound TCP port from THIS process (acting
;; as the SFTP client — see kotobase.sftp.transport.ssh's own docstring
;; for why that client is demo/test-only, not a general-purpose library),
;; and proves the full protocol stack for real:
;;
;;   version exchange -> SSH_MSG_KEXINIT negotiation -> curve25519-sha256
;;   ECDH key exchange with an ed25519 host-key signature the client
;;   actually verifies -> SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS -> aes128-ctr encryption +
;;   hmac-sha2-256 integrity on every packet from that point on ->
;;   accept-any 'none' userauth -> one 'session' channel -> 'subsystem
;;   sftp' -> SSH_FXP_INIT/VERSION -> a real mkdir/write/close/open/
;;   read/stat/readdir/rename/remove/rmdir sequence against the SECOND
;;   PROCESS's own in-memory kotobase.local store, with every one of
;;   those SFTP requests and responses actually traveling as CIPHERTEXT
;;   (encrypted+MAC'd) over the real socket between the two processes.
;;
;; This is proof by protocol response, not proof by log line (unlike
;; DTN's scenario 1, SFTP has no analogous 'read the child's own stdout'
;; signal to check — the DATA THAT COMES BACK ACROSS THE ENCRYPTED
;; CHANNEL, matching exactly what this process asked the OTHER process to
;; store, IS the proof: if the KEXINIT negotiation, ECDH math, key
;; derivation, AES-CTR encryption/decryption, or HMAC verification were
;; wrong in either process, the SFTP responses below would either never
;; arrive (MAC rejection closes the connection — see
;; kotobase.sftp.transport.wire's feed! docstring) or would decrypt to
;; garbage that fails to parse as a valid SFTP packet.
;;
;; HONEST SCOPE (restated from kotobase.sftp.transport.ssh's own
;; docstring, worth repeating here): this proves this repo's OWN
;; hand-rolled client and server correctly interoperate with EACH OTHER,
;; across two real OS processes, over a real socket, with a real
;; encrypted channel. It does NOT prove interop with a real OpenSSH
;; client or server — no such test exists in this repo, and none is
;; claimed to.
;;
;; Prints PASS/FAIL per check, a final "RESULT: N/M checks passed" line,
;; and exits 0 iff every check passed (else 1). Run from this repo's
